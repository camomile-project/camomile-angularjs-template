# Camomile / AngularJS frontend template

This repository provides a simple [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) template that can be used as a starting point to build web frontend based on any Camomile REST API [backend](http://github.com/camomile-project/camomile-server).

In particular, 

  * the `camomileService` makes it easy to interact with the [backend](http://github.com/camomile-project/camomile-server) by encapsulating the Camomile Javascript [client](http://github.com/camomile-project/camomile-client-javascript).
  * the `CamomileCtrl` controller takes care of user authentication.

Fork and enjoy!
